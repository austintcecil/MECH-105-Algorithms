# False Position Root Finding Algorithm #
This is an algorithm that uses the false position method to find the roots of a function, using an upper and lower initial guess 
## Inputs:
- func- the function being evaluated
- l- the lower guess
- u- the upper guess
- es- the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%)
- maxit- the maximum number of iterations to use (should default to 200)
-varargin, . . . - any additional parameters used by the function 
## Outputs:
- root- the estimated root location
- fx- the function evaluated at the root location
- ea- the approximate relative error (%)
- iter- how many iterations were performed
## Example:
- to find the root of a polynomial function for example 3x^2-2x
