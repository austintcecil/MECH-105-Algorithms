# Simspons 1/3 Rule Algorithm
Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
# Inputs
- x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
- y = the vector of function values with respect to x
# Outputs:
- I = the numerical integral calculated
# Example:
- Evaluating the integral of a non-continuous function or of a data table
