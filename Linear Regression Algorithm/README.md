# Linear Regression Algorithm 
This algorithm computes the linear regression of a data set and computes the associated R^2 value 
- Filters outliers from the data set.
- Computes the linear regression on the filtered data set.
- Computes the value from the filtered data and the linear regression function.
# Inputs: 
- x-values of the data set
- y-values of the data set
# Outputs:
- Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
- Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
- Slope from the linear regression (m in )
- Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
- Rsquared value
# Example:
-Filtering and computing the linear regression for a non-linear and non-continuous data set, for example performing linear regression on a data set recorded using a sensor that only records data over specific intervals.
